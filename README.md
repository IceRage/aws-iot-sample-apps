# Sample applications using the AWS IoT Platform.

The current list of sample applications:

1. [01_random_number](examples/01_random_number): One application periodically sends a __randomly generated number__ to an instance of the AWS IoT Platform service. A second application subscribes to receiving and printing to standard output the number sent by the first application.
 
If you are interested in other examples please let me know and, time permitting, I will publish further sample applications here.
